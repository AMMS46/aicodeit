Tool Description: AI Code Iterator for Game Developers

This tool is designed to assist game developers in modifying their code more efficiently. It's an AI-powered code editor that takes natural language prompts and applies the described changes to a given code snippet.

Working:

Input:
The developer provides two inputs:
A natural language prompt describing the desired code modification (e.g., "Rename the variable 'player_speed' to 'speed'").
The actual code snippet they want to modify.

Processing:
The tool uses a combination of:
Langchain: A framework for building language model applications.
Google Gemini: A large language model (LLM) that understands the prompt and generates the modified code.

The process involves:
A carefully crafted prompt template that instructs the LLM on how to modify code.
The LLM analyzes the provided prompt and code snippet.
The LLM generates a response containing:

An explanation of the changes it made.
The modified code snippet.

Output:
The tool displays the results:
A clear explanation of the code modifications.
The modified code snippet, formatted for readability.

Capabilities:
Code Modification: The core function is to automatically modify code based on natural language instructions.  This can include tasks like:
Renaming variables.
Updating function parameters.
Refactoring code structures.
Explanations: The tool provides explanations for the changes it makes, helping developers understand the modifications.

Streamlit Interface: The tool has a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, making it easy to use.

Game Development Focus: While the tool can be used for general code modification, the prompt template is designed with game development in mind.
